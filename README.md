# Deepfake Detection using ResNeXt50 and LSTM

This project is a Deepfake Detection system designed to identify manipulated video content using a combination of CNN and RNN-based architectures. The main objective of this project was to gain a deeper understanding of how deepfakes are created and how machine learning techniques can be used to detect them effectively.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Deepfakes pose a significant threat in the age of digital media, enabling realistic manipulations of audio-visual content. This project explores how to detect such manipulations using a powerful hybrid deep learning architecture that combines:

- **ResNeXt50** for spatial feature extraction.
- **LSTM** for capturing temporal relationships across video frames.

## 🎯 Purpose

The purpose of this project was to:
- Understand how deepfakes work under the hood.
- Build a reliable model capable of detecting deepfake videos.
- Deploy the system using modern web technologies.
